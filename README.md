## Description

This repository features a collection of classic logic games implemented in React, providing interactive gameplay and challenging puzzles.

## Games Included

### Picas y Fijas (Bulls and Cows)

Picas y Fijas is a classic logic game where players guess a hidden number based on feedback provided for each guess:

- **Objective**: Guess the hidden number sequence within the specified number of attempts.
- **Gameplay**: Players input a number and receive feedback in terms of "picas" (correct digits in wrong position) and "fijas" (correct digits in correct position).
- **Levels**: Each level increases in difficulty by adding more digits to the hidden sequence, challenging players as they progress.

## Technologies Used

- **React**: Frontend library for building interactive user interfaces. Used to create dynamic gameplay elements, manage game state, and handle user interactions.
- **JavaScript (ES6+)**: Core language for implementing game logic, handling data manipulation, and defining game rules.
- **HTML/CSS**: Used for structuring the game layout and styling user interface elements to enhance usability and visual appeal.
- **LocalStorage**: Utilized to store user progress, such as the highest level achieved in each game, allowing players to resume where they left off.
